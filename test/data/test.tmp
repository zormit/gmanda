  "def: Despite xfce being no small project, the maintainer does not believe
  that the project fits with Google's profile and does not have the time to take
  care of it himself. No further action is taken, which might be another good
  example of the maintainer might syndrome.

  memo: This is a short episode only involving very little discussion.

  Ori proposes this *enthusiastically* and *sets a clear timeframe* by which it
  would have to be executed (with GSoC this means to write up project ideas).

  When after one week no response has been received, he *restarts* the
  discussion by brainstorming himself.

  To this Harold replies adding more ideas, yet not indicating any preference
  for accepting the proposal directly. His ideas get *side tracked* into two
  discussions with two separate project members about the ideas and their merit.

  In between the maintainer states that he does not have time, thus indicating
  that he will not execute this innovation and provides *negative past
  experiences* with the innovation (failure to be accepted). There is no further
  post by the innovator. I think it is reasonable to argue that while not
  directly rejecting, the discussion was *damped* too much by this.",

  memo: Thinking about discussions leading to decisions regarding adoption of
  innovation, we see another possible source for arguments: The 'I'. 'I don't
  have time', 'I am inexperienced with this', etc.

  To recapture the one's we have so far: the innovation itself (capability
  codes), experiences made by others or in the past (external codes), the
  structure of the discussion and tactic employed.",
